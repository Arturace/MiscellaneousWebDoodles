# The name means nothing!

*They are hardly flashy*

## What is this?
This short project contains a web-component that would replace your `fieldset` tag.

## Why is this?
The whole point, is to make an **appealing visual selection** of the radio type input.

The demo is hardly pretty (or flashy), but it is a working proof of concept. The styling is up to the code user.

## Build
Project contains some `scss` files, so you will need to run the following to build it:

```bash
npm run scss
```

Or, if you want `node-sass` to watch for changes:

```bash
npm run scss-w
```
