# Welcome to My Miscellaneous Web Doodles

They represent (mostly) bite-sized projects for things that come to mind when I'm at work or procrastinating.

To avoid procrastinating, I decided to make this repository.
The goal is to actually try executing my ideas instead of forgetting all about them.
